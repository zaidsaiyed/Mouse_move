# Random Mouse Mover
A Python script that uses the `pyautogui` and `keyboard` libraries to randomly move the mouse cursor on the screen.

## Requirements
-   Python 3.7 or higher
-   `pyautogui` module (can be installed using `pip install pyautogui`)
-   `keyboard` module (can be installed using `pip install keyboard`)

## Usage
1.  Clone or download the repository
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory where the script is located
3.  Run the script using the following command: `python random_mouse_mover.py`
4.  The mouse cursor will start moving randomly on the screen
5.  To stop the script, press and hold the "ctrl+alt+shift+z" key combination for 1-2 seconds

## Note
-   The screen resolution is set to 1920x1080, but it can be changed in the code.
-   The script generates random X and Y coordinates and moves the mouse cursor to that position with a random duration of time.
